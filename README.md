## Game World Features

### Nature Laws
In the game world, the laws of nature largely mirror those of the real world, but with subtle supernatural alterations tied to the witch's influence. The forest and witch's house follow standard physical rules, with a few exceptions:

- The candy-like materials are not only edible but possess a dark enchantment that possibly ensnares the children, leading them into traps or dilluting their consciousness.

- The witch’s magic allows her to posses teleportation, superhuman speed and strength, which adds to the feeling of dread and the horror atmosphere.

These elements emphasize the unnaturalness of the world, as the children are constantly navigating a space where danger lurks behind every corner and the rules of survival are bent by the witch’s magic.

### Geography
The story is set in a deep, dark forest, which is both vast and foreboding.

- The forest is thick with trees and shadows, leading the children to the witch's house.

- The house is a color-fest at the heart of the forest, creating an atmosphere of isolation and entrapment.

The geography of the forest and the witch’s house is designed to disorient and create a sense of isolation.
It also emphasises that even when finally escaping the witch's house, they are still facing other dangers around it - leaving an open ending to the story.

### History
The story of *Hansel and Gretel* originated from German folklore, famously recorded by the Brothers Grimm in 1812. 
In the original tale, the children are abandoned in a dark forest by their parents, only to find themselves lured into a house made of candy by a wicked witch who plans to eat them. 
The story has been interpreted as a cautionary tale about survival, resourcefulness, and the dangers of strangers.

In our game, this traditional narrative is maintained with the added element of horror gameplay.
The house is still made of candy, but now it serves as a sinister and dangerous trap where sweets are not just tempting, but perilous.
The children’s goal remains the same: to escape the witch’s house, but their journey is filled with peril, and every decision could lead to a grim end.

### Biology
The game maintains a consistent biological framework with the real world, but with supernatural touches:

- The witch herself is an unnatural creature, possibly with the ability to manipulate her environment. She is able to use dark magic to create deadly traps within her house.

- The candy-like structures (gingerbread, chocolate fountains, etc.) are all animated by the witch's will, capable of ensnaring the children or reacting to their presence in strange ways.
  This adds to the sense that the children are not in a normal world but in a twisted, magical place where even the environment itself can be hostile.

While the biology of the creatures and environment might resemble the real world, the dark magic that permeates everything twists these natural rules, adding a layer of supernatural danger.

## Enjoyability

In our game, we enhance the *Hansel and Gretel* story by expanding descriptions through alternate paths, making the world more immersive and engaging. Here's how we add more detail:

### Alternative Paths
The witch's house in the original story is briefly described. 
In our game, however, it is possible to try escaping via different routes.

Examples for routes you might find via the game:
- **Candy Kitchen**: A kitchen filled with sweet scents and enchanted tools, contrasting with the danger around them.
- **Living Room**: A seemingly safe room with candy furniture, but the witch’s presence is felt, creating tension.

### Choice-Based Descriptions
The game alternates between tension-building and action-driven moments based on player choices.

For example:
- **Hiding Under the Bed**: Describes the witch’s eerie movements and the children’s quiet fear.
- **Running Through the House**: Shifts to a frantic, chaotic description as they search for an escape.

These choices influence how much description the player encounters, making the game feel dynamic.

### The Witch’s Influence
The witch’s presence is conveyed through her magic and the environment:
- **Haunted House**: The house decays or reacts to the witch’s magic, creating a sense of unease.
- **Enchanted Objects**: Descriptions of deadly magical traps and the witch’s steps reinforce her constant presence.

## Challenge

### Challenges in the Original Story

In the original *Hansel and Gretel* tale, the children face multiple life-threatening challenges. 
First, they are abandoned in the forest, left to survive on their own. They initially use breadcrumbs to find their way back, but the birds eat them. 
The most dangerous challenge comes when they encounter the witch, who lures them into her house with food and shelter, only to imprison them for cooking. 
The children must outsmart the witch to survive, with Gretel’s cleverness ultimately leading to their escape. 
The final challenge is finding their way home through the forest, evading further dangers.

### How the Game Builds on These Challenges

In our game, these classic challenges are expanded into an interactive, horror-filled experience, emphasizing on escaping the witch's hut.
The children must navigate through the witch’s house, which is filled with dangerous traps and magical obstacles.
The witch is a constant threat, always keeping the children on their toes with every move they make.
Players must use their wits to escape the house, with many paths leading to either death or survival based on the player’s decisions.
The gameplay emphasizes resourcefulness, just like the original story, but now with an added layer of suspense and danger.

### How the Game Enhances the Story for Players Familiar with the Original

For players who know the *Hansel and Gretel* story, the game provides a thrilling new take.
The plot remains familiar, but the choices are more complex, adding tension and unpredictability.
Players who are already familiar with the original story will be excited by new ways to defeat the witch or new ways to die, making the horror elements even more impactful.

### How the Game Is Challenging for New Players

Even for players unfamiliar with the original story, the game is just as engaging.
The narrative is conveyed through choices, meaning players can experience the tension and danger of the witch’s house without prior knowledge of the plot.
The gameplay itself challenges players with strategic decisions, where one wrong choice can lead to death.
The horror elements are designed to keep everyone on edge, ensuring that new players still find the game thrilling and immersive.
